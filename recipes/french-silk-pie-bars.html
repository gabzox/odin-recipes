            <li>Prepare filling. Place chocolate in a bowl set over a large saucepan of simmering water (bowl should not touch water). Cook, stirring frequenly, until chocolate is melted. Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, whisk together eggs, 3/4 cup white sugar, brown sugar, water and salt in another bowl that fits over the saucepan.

Spread chocolate mixture evenly over the cooled trust and chill in the refrigerator until the chocolate mixture is nearly set, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, for topping, beat cream cheese in a bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Add 3 tablespoons white sugar, 1 teaspoon vanila, and a pinch of salt. Beat on medium-low until smooth, scraping down the sides as needed. Slowly beat in 1 1/2 cups whipping cream on low speed until combined.
